          User represents a Butler user account.
          Users can authenticate via SSO (OIDC) or with email/password (internal).

          SSO User Flow:
          1. User clicks "Sign in with Google/Okta/etc"
          2. Butler creates User CRD automatically on first login
          3. User is matched to Teams by email address

          Internal User Flow:
          1. Admin creates User with email (no password)
          2. Butler generates invite token, returns URL to admin
          3. Admin shares invite URL with user (via Slack, email, etc.)
          4. User clicks link, sets their own password
          5. Password is hashed (bcrypt) and stored in a Secret
          6. User status changes from Pending to Active

          Platform Admin:
          Users with spec.isPlatformAdmin=true have full platform access,
          bypassing team-based RBAC. This should be used sparingly.
